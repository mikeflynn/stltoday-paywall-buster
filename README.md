# STLToday Paywall Buster

## v2022

The repo and browser extension is back!

## v2021

This repo has been retired in favor of this actively updated Gist that creates a bookmarklet to get around the STLToday paywall: https://gist.github.com/mikeflynn/bc92e4d1ad1d09253c4c44fcb99a439c

## v2014

A browser user script to prevent the [STLToday.com](http://stltoday.com) (the website of St. Louis' major newspaper, The Post Dispatch) paywall from activating by simply marking the content as free. See how to install this on your browser of choice (Chrome or Firefox are preferred) here: [wiki.greasespot.net/Cross-browser_userscripting](http://wiki.greasespot.net/Cross-browser_userscripting)
